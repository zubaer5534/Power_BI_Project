# Power_BI_Project

## Maven Market Analysis

I undertook a comprehensive data analysis project, working with Maven Market data. To effectively manage and visualize the data, I utilized the power of Power BI. Firstly, I connected to the Maven Market data using Power Query to modify it to ensure its accuracy and consistency and prepare it for analysis.
Secondly, I made the relationship between the fact table and dimension table as a snowflake schema. Thirdly, I built 20+ DEX which allowed me to derive key metrics, perform advanced calculations, and generate meaningful insights from the data.
Finally, I built an Interactive and Dynamic dashboard. I added additional pages to drill down Product Brand to Product Brand Details.
